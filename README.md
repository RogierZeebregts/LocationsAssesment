- Make possible to order the cities alphabetically (ASC & DESC) the default is ASC 

- Introduce an input field that filters the stores based on: addressName or cityname 

- Add autocompletion to the field and show wether the autocompletion is a cityname or an addressname. Cities should have a green background and storeNames should have a red background
